Anything that doesn't work:  Should work overall.  Occasional issues with disconnection or loss of messages (not being recieved).  This typically is either open player selection/areeing to start game or the first 3 moves of the first game.  Should be good there otherwise.  This works between two of my apps and seems to work with Jack Hess' on sending grid selections.
